## Security Risk regarding Data Scientists:

- Credentials : Easy passwords, saving passwords
- Physical security : computer hardware stolen
- Social Engineering : Phishing emails, scam
- 3rd party packages

- Version Control Risks
- API Security Risks (e.g. SQL injection, Cross-site scripting, etc.)

## Tools
- Secure Coding tools
  - SonarQube, Checkmarx, Dependabot (by GitHub)
