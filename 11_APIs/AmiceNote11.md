## Key point:




From the book and further research, I would like to summarize REST API vs FastAPI

| REST API | FastAPI |
| --- | --- |
| an architectural style  | a specific *Python framework* built to create APIs rapidly |
| can vary in performance depending | high performance due to its *asynchronous capabilities* |
| documentation requires manual effort  | automatic documentation (tools : Swagger UI or ReDoc) |
| can be designed to be asynchronous in some framework | fully supports asynchronous programming |
| more manual configuration and setup | designed for rapid development |
| a variety of frameworks and libraries, each with its community | has gained popularity in the Python community | 
| eg. Read-Time Data Analytics Dashboard | eg. SalesForce |
