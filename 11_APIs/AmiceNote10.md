## Key point:

From the book and further resarch I would like to summarize REST API vs FastAPI

| REST API | FastAPI |
| --- | --- |
| is an architectural style that defines a set of principles for designing network-based software systems. | is a specific Python framework built to create APIs rapidly |
| can vary in performance depending on the specific framework and implementation details| high performance and speed due to its asynchronous capabilities and efficient handling of requests and responses |
| automatically generates interactive API documentation based on the provided code, using tools like Swagger UI or ReDoc | may require more manual effort |
| can be designed to be asynchronous, not all frameworks provide native support for asynchronous operations | fully supports asynchronous programming, allowing for high concurrency and improved performance |
| may require more manual configuration and setup, potentially leading to longer development cycles | designed for rapid development and aims to maximize developer productivity through features like automatic validation, documentation, and type inference |
| often relies on a variety of frameworks and libraries, each with its own community and ecosystem, which can vary in size and support | has gained popularity in the Python community due to its modern approach and extensive documentation |
