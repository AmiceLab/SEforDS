## Key point:

### 1. Types of Testing
- automated code testing - write code to test (Test-Driven Development, TDD, our focus)
- user testing - by another team

### 2. How to Write and Run Tests

Using Fit_Trendline function

Running Automated Tests with :

- Pytest 

  ```
  pip install pytest

  ```

- tox

### 3. Taking care of other levels of Tests

Unit/Integration/Acceptance/Loads/Security/Usability


### 4. Data Validation

```
pip install pydantic
```

### 5. Testing for Machine Learning

- Data exploration
- Feature Engineering
- Model training & testing
- Model evaluation
- Model monitoring
