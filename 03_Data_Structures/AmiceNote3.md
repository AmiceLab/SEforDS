## Key point:

- Set
- NumPy Arrays
  - good for multi-dimensional data
  - because only contain one type of data
- pandas DataFrames - 2-dimension, for data science, for for basic analysis
  - loaded in memory, problem for large dataset. To solve:
  - only load the required columns
  - use chucksize arguement to create an iterator, only a subset of rows at a time
