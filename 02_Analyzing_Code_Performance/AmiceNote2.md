## Key point:

### Simple tasks

- Time your code >>> %%timeit

### Large amount of code :

- cProfile %%prun
  - gives a detailed breakdown of how the computer spends its time
  - pip install line_profiler
  - %load_ext line_profiler

- Memray
  - memray run mode_using_counter.py

### Others
- Big O Notation
  - O(1) - Constant time, time anyway required regardless of dataset size
  - O(n) - linear time, time with the size of dataset
  - O(n^2) - quadratic time, time may exponential increase with the size of dataset, accumulating effect
